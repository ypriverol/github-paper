Short title: Ten Simple Rules for taking advantage of GitHub

## Introduction

Bioinformatics is a broad discipline in which the common denominator
is the need to produce and/or use software that can be applied to
biological data in different contexts. To enable and ensure the
replicability and traceability of scientific claims, it is essential that the
scientific publication, the corresponding datasets and the data
analysis are made publicly available
\cite{Goodman:2014,Perez-Riverol:2015}. All software used for the
analysis should be either carefully documented (e.g. for commercial
software) or, better, openly shared and directly accessible to others
\cite{Osborne:2014,Vihinen:2015}.  The rise of openly available software
and source code, and concomitant collaborative development is
facilitated by the existence of several code repository services such
as SourceForge (http://sourceforge.net/), Bitbucket
(https://bitbucket.org/) and GitHub (https://github.com/), among
others. These resources are also essential for collaborative software
projects, since they enable the organisation and sharing of
programming tasks between different remote contributors. Here, we
introduce the main features of GitHub, a popular web-based platform
which offers a free and integrated environment for hosting the source
code, documentation and project-related web content for open source projects. GitHub also
offers paid plans for private repositories. GitHub relies, at its
core, on the well-known and open source version control system git,
designed and developed by Linus Torvalds for the development of the
Linux kernel. One reason for GitHub's success is that it offers more
than a simple source code hosting service. It provides developers with
a dynamic and collaborative environment, often coined as social coding
platform, with the ability to review, comment and discuss code
\cite{Dabbish:2012}. Individual bioinformatics projects (https://github.com/lgatto/MSnbase) \cite{Gatto15012012}, 
lab repositories (https://github.com/PRIDE-Toolsuite/) \cite{Perez-Riverol01012016}, intermediate projects such as (https://github.com/samtools) and 
OpenMS (https://github.com/OpenMS) \cite{sturm2008openms}; or global collaborations such as ROpenSci (https://github.com/ropensci) 
and The Global Allience For Genomics and Health (https://github.com/ga4gh) has found the perfect place in GitHub to share code, ideas and collaborate.

Some of our recommendations outlined below are applicable to other
hosting services. However our main aim here is to highlight specific
GitHub features. We provide a set of recommendations to take full
advantage of GitHub's features to manage small and large
bioinformatics projects and increase their profile and
visibility. These rules have been ordered to reflect a typical development process: 
learning git and GitHub basics, use of branches, labeling and tagging of code snapshots,
tracking project bugs and enhancements using issues, and disemination of the final results.

## Rule 1. Structure your projects: repositories, users, organisations and teams

Open source projects on GitHub are visible to everyone, but write
permissions, i.e. the possibility to directly modify the content, need
to explicitly be granted. One of the key concepts in GitHub is the repositories where 
the data, code and content is stored. Repositories (the shortened term is _repo_) are versioned directories or dedicated
storage spaces for your software projects, which can be included inside an organisation or can belong to particular users. Users can
usually keep code, text files, images and small data files inside a repo. And while many users store programs and code projects,
there is nothing preventing users from keeping text documents such as analysis reports and manuscripts (see for example the repository for this
manuscript at https://github.com/ypriverol/github-paper), or other file types in your projects. Note that until recently, GitHub was lacking
support for storing large files (>100 MB), a issue that has been recently addressed by the GitHub large file storage. 
Everyone with a GitHub account can fork any public repository and start developing in one's own
fork. A fork is a copy of a repository. Forking a repository allows you to freely experiment with changes
without affecting the original project (https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/). This forking is
the basis of social coding. It allows anyone to develop and test novel features into existing code and offers the
possibility to merge novel features back the into the main project,
thereby becoming a contributor.  Project managers can structure projects to
manage permissions and restrict access at different levels: users,
teams and organisations.  Users are the keystone of GitHub, as for any
other social network. Every user has a profile listing their GitHub
projects and activities, which can be populated optionally with
personal information including name, e-mail address, image and
webpage. To stay up to date with the activity of other users one can
_follow_ their accounts. Collaboration can be achieved by simply
adding a trusted _Collaborator_ and thereby granting write
access. However, development in large projects is usually done by
teams of people, within a larger organisation. GitHub organisations
are a great way to manage team-based access permissions for the
individual projects of institutes, research labs, and large open
source projects that need multiple owners and administrators (Fig.
1). We recommend that you (as an individual researcher) make your
profile visible to other users and display all the projects and
organisations you are working in, including a list of the latest
activities on the site (Fig. 1).

## Rule 2. Learn Git and embrace its power

The cornerstone of GitHub is the distributed version control system
git. Every change, from fixing a typo to a complete redesign of the
software, is controlled by versions, so called revisions. While
beginners may consider the learning curve of Git steep, many
introductory and detailed tutorials are available. A revision can be
considered as a _snapshot_ (version) of a file system. Git is
remarkably effective in archiving the complete history of a project
(all revisions) by, amongst other things, storing only the differences
among them. To create a new revision, the set of changes introduced (e.g. new,
deleted or modified files) are committed to the
repository. Following the rule: "commit often, as most as you can,
perfection later", one can keep track of the development in small
incremental changes. At any time it is possible to go back to a
previous version. In larger projects, multiple users contribute to the
same repository.

## Rule 3. Use branches

Concurrent development including commits to the same
repository can be organised using several common approaches. The most
common way is to use git _branches_ to separate different lines of
development. Active development is often performed on a development
branch and stable versions e.g. those used for a software release,
are kept in a master branch. In practice, developers work on one or
several features or improvements. To keep commits of the different
features logically separated, distinct branches are typically
used. Later, when development is complete and none of the tests fail
(see Rule 6) new features can be merged back into the development line
or master branch. During such a development, the original branch might
continuously be developed and other features might be merged into the
master branch. Nevertheless, one can always pull the currently up-to
date master branch into one branch, always enabling to react or adapt
to the changes in the code. In projects involving more than one
contributor, everyone wants to be sure that the contributions of
others increase the quality and move the project forward. _Forking_ a
repository and providing _pull requests_ constitute an easy way for
collaboration inside and over organisations boundaries. A user that
forks a repository creates a copy under their GitHub account. Modifications like a
branch with new features or bug fixes can conveniently be provided to
the forked (upstream) repository by opening a pull request. Once it is
opened for review and discussion, it usually results in additional
insights and in an increased code quality. Once a pull request gets
accepted, typically it gets merged into the development branch. 
One of the easiest ways to make a mess for yourself with Git is to allow your _branch_ to get
out of sync. Branches are just short-term departures from master. If you
pull frequently, you will keep your copy of the repo up to date, and you will
have the opportunity to merge your changed code with others' contributors. 

## Rule 4. Use tags and semantic version numbering

Tags offer the possibility to label versions during the development
process, tracking its progress. Version numbering should follow semantic versioning in the
form X.Y.Z, with X being the major, Y the minor and Z the patch
version of the release, including possible meta information, as
described in http://semver.org/. Correct labelling allows developers
and users to easily recover older versions, compare them, or simply
use them to reproduce results described in publications (see Rule 8). This
approach will also help defining a coherent software publication
strategy (see Rule 6).

## Rule 5. The code must always be ready to use: continuously integrate

The first rule of software development is that the code needs to be
ready to use as soon as possible \cite{Leprevost:2014}, remain so during
development, and should be well-documented and tested. In 2005, Martin
Fowler defined the basic principles for continuous integration in
software development \cite{FowlerCI}. These principles have become the
main reference for best practices in continuous integration, providing
the framework needed to deploy software, and in some way also
data. Every repository, script, mathematical model, and function
should contain a set of self-automated tests. A source code may run,
but that does not mean it is doing the right thing. The simple use of
those self-automated tests is to detect possible bugs introduced by
new features, or changes in the code or dependencies, but also to
detect wrong results, the so called _logic errors_, where the source
code produces a different result compared to what one intended it to
do. Then, continuous integration provides the way of automatically run
all of these tests in the repository by checking data and software
dependencies. Continuous integration can be done automatically on
GitHub (See Rule 6).

## Rule 6: Automate for better code quality

GitHub offers different types of hooks that are executed after each
push to a repository, making easier to follow the basic
principles of continuous integration. The GitHub web hooks allows
third-party platforms to access and interact with a GitHub
repository and thus to automate post-processing tasks. Such tasks
demonstrate to the community that a project follows rigorous
software engineering processes, often associated with high quality
development. It also shows that is currently working and has documentation that reflects
the current code. We suggest that all these three tasks become part of your
project. Firstly, continuous integration can be achieved by _Travis_
(https://travis-ci.org), a hosted continued integration platform that
is free for all open source projects. Travis builds and tests the
source code using a plethora of options such as different platforms
and interpreter versions. Furthermore it offers notifications which
allow your team and contributors to know if the new changes work, and
prevent the introduction of errors in the code, making the repo always
ready to use. 
Secondly, in addition to successful completion of the tests, one can
also demonstrate that they cover the existing code base sufficiently. For this task, the
integration of _Codecov_ is recommended (https://codecov.io). Thirdly,
one might consider to automatically update the documentation upon code
modification. This implies that your projects provide comprehensive
documentation so others can understand, and contribute back to them. For Python or C/C++ code, automatic documentation generation
can be done using sphinx (http://sphinx-doc.org/) and subsequently
integrated into GitHub using "Read the Docs"
(https://readthedocs.org/). All of these platforms will create reports
and badges (also called shields) for the projects that can be included
on your GitHub page, thereby making your projects easily identifiable
as high quality and well-maintained.

## Rule 7. Use and maintain your issue trackers

GitHub _issues_ are a great way to keep track of bugs, tasks, and
enhancements. Classical issue trackers are primarily intended to be
used as bug trackers. In contrast, GitHub issues follow a different
philosophy: each tracker has its own section in every repository, and
can be used to trace bugs, new ideas, and enhancements, by using a
powerful but optional tagging system for each issue. Its main focus is
put in promoting collaboration, providing context by using
cross-references, and an excellent text formatting for each issue: (i)
a title and description, (ii) colour-coded labels help to
categorise and filter issues, (iii) milestones act as a container
for issues,(iv) one assignee responsible for working on the issue, and (v)
comments that allow anyone with access to the repository to provide
feedback. Another aspect is its simplicity. For instance, it does not
require to fill lengthy forms including every piece of information
that might be valuable to reproduce the bug. It only requires
to give the title and provide some optional text. If the developer
needs more information, they can simply request it in a comment. GitHub
issues are then more dynamic and pose a lower barrier for users to
report bugs and request features. A well-organised and tagged issue
tracker will help upcoming contributors and users to understand a
project more deeply.


## Rule 8. Make your code easily citable, and cite source code!

In research, it is a good practice to ensure permanent and unambiguous
identifiers for citable items like articles, datasets, or biological
entities such as proteins, genes and metabolites, among
others. Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs) have been used for many
years as unique and unambiguous identifiers for enabling the citation
of scientific publications. More recently, a trend has started to
produce DOIs for other types of scientific outputs such as datasets
\cite{Vizcaino:2014} or training materials (for example
\cite{Ahmadia_2015_27353}). The main motivation behind this is to give
scientists a better credit for their work \cite{NatBiotechEditorial:2009},
enabling at the same time a better way to cite and track it. In addition, funding agencies such as NIH now accept 
other research products as citable research such as accessible datasets and softwares.
A common issue with software is that it normally evolves at a different speed
than what is published in the scientific literature. In fact, it is
common to find software having novel features and functionalities that
were not described in the original publication. GitHub now enables the
use of DOIs to cite the code deposited, using the data archiving tool
Zenodo (https://zenodo.org/). The procedure is simple (see
https://guides.github.com/activities/citable-code/) and, by default,
Zenodo takes an archive of a repository each time a new release is
created in GitHub. However, before Zenodo can issue a DOI, metadata
needs to be provided about the archived repository. Once the DOI has
been assigned, apart from using it in your CV, you can add it to
literature information resources such as Europe PubMed Central
\cite{EuropePMCConsortium:2015}.
As already mentioned in the introduction, reproducibility of
scientific claims should be enabled by providing openly the software,
the datasets and the process leading to interpretable results that are
used in a particular study. One should always highlight as much as
possible in publications that the code is freely available in,
for example, GitHub, together with any other relevant piece of
information that may have been deposited. In our experience, this
openness substantially increases your chances of getting the paper
accepted for publication. Journal editors and reviewers
have the opportunity to reproduce your findings during the manuscript
review process, increasing the confidence of your results. In addition, once the paper is published, your work can be reproduced
by any member of the scientific community, which can increase
citations and foster opportunities for further discussion and
collaboration. Also one must have in mind that the availability of a public repository with
the source code does not make the software open source _per se_,
as it needs to have an appropriate license
(http://opensource.org/licenses/).

## Rule 9. Promote your projects in the scientific community - create a web page and more

The traditional and effective way of promoting scientific software is by
publishing them in the peer-reviewed scientific literature. Additional steps can be done to boost the visibility of a
organisation. For example, GitHub _Pages_ are simple landing webpages
that GitHub hosts for free without the need for a server or
database. GitHub users can create and host blog websites, help pages,
manuals, tutorials and websites related to specific projects. _Pages_
comes with a powerful static site generator called Jekyll
(https://jekyllrb.com) that can be integrated with other platforms
such as Bootstrap (http://getbootstrap.com/) or Disqus
(https://disqus.com/), to support and moderate comments.
In addition, GitHub also provides mechanisms for real-time
communication called Gitter (http://gitter.im). Gitter is a
GitHub-based chat tool (in limited beta at the time of writing) which
enables developers and users to share aspects of their work. Gitter
inherits the shape of the social groups operating around GitHub
repositories, organisations, and issues. It relies on the identity
within GitHub, creating IRC (Internet Relay Chat)-like chat rooms for
public and private repositories. From within a Gitter chat, members
can reference issues, comments, or pull-requests. A different service
is Gist (https://gist.github.com), which represents a unique way to
share _code snippets_, single files, parts of files, or full
applications. Gist can be generated in two different ways: public _gists_, that can be
browsed and searched, and secret gists that are not provided through
_Discover_ (https://gist.github.com/discover). One of the main
features of Gist is the possibility to embed code snippets in other
applications, enabling users to embed gists in any text field that
supports JavaScript.

## Rule 10. Check periodically existing open source projects

One of the main tasks of scientists is to actively follow the developments in
their field. Analogously, scientific programmers need to revise
publicly available (e.g. open source) projects and code that can be interesting for their
research. Therefore, you should try to learn as much as possible from your peers
and keep up-to-date with all the developments of
relevant projects. GitHub enables this functionality by _following_ other
GitHub users (also mentioned in Rule 1) or _watching_ the activity of projects, which is a common
feature in many social media platforms. Take advantage of it as much
as possible!

## Conclusions

If you are interested and have not used GitHub so far, we recommend
you to get started as soon as possible. As in any other topic, a
learning curve is required for beginners. However, we anticipate the
reward will be worth your effort.
