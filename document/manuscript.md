# Introduction {-}

Bioinformatics is a broad discipline in which one common denominator
is the need to produce and/or use software that can be applied to
biological data in different contexts. To enable and ensure the
replicability and traceability of scientific claims, it is essential
that the scientific publication, the corresponding datasets, and the
data analysis are made publicly available
\cite{Goodman:2014,Perez-Riverol:2015}. All software used for the
analysis should be either carefully documented (e.g., for commercial
software) or better, openly shared and directly accessible to others
\cite{Osborne:2014,Vihinen:2015}.  The rise of openly available
software and source code alongside concomitant collaborative development is
facilitated by the existence of several code repository services such
as SourceForge (\url{http://sourceforge.net/}), Bitbucket
(\url{https://bitbucket.org/}), GitLab (\url{https://about.gitlab.com/}), and
GitHub (\url{https://github.com/}), among others. These resources are also
essential for collaborative software projects, since they enable the
organization and sharing of programming tasks between different remote
contributors. Here, we introduce the main features of GitHub, a
popular web-based platform that offers a free and integrated
environment for hosting the source code, documentation, and
project-related web content for open source projects. GitHub also
offers paid plans for private repositories (see Box 2) for individuals
and businesses, as well as free plans including private repositories for
research and educational use.

GitHub relies, at its core, on the well-known and open source version
control system git, originally designed by Linus Torvalds for the development of
the Linux kernel, and now developed and maintained by the git
community (\url{https://github.com/git}). One reason for GitHub's success is
that it offers more than a simple source code hosting service
\cite{blischak2016quick, ram2013git}. It provides developers and
researchers with a dynamic and collaborative environment, often
referred to as a social coding platform, that supports peer review,
commenting and discussion \cite{Dabbish:2012}. A diverse range of
efforts, ranging from individual to large bioinformatics projects, laboratory
repositories, as well as global collaborations have found
GitHub to be a productive place to share code, ideas and collaborate (see Table 1).

Some of the recommendations outlined below are broadly applicable to repository
hosting services. However our main aim is to highlight specific GitHub features.
We provide a set of recommendations that we believe will help the reader to take
full advantage of GitHub's features for managing and promoting projects in
bioinformatics as well as in many other research domains.
The recommendations are ordered to reflect a typical development
process: learning git and GitHub basics, collaboration, use of
branches and pull requests, labeling and tagging of code snapshots,
tracking project bugs and enhancements using issues, and dissemination
of the final results.

# Rule 1. Use GitHub to track your projects {-}

The backbone of GitHub is the distributed version control system
_git_. Every change, from fixing a typo to a complete redesign of the
software, is tracked and controlled by a unique
identifier. While git has a complex set of commands and can be used
for rather complex operations, learning to apply the basics 
requires only a handful of new concepts and commands, and will provide a
solid ground to efficiently track code and related content for research projects. Many introductory and detailed tutorials are available (see
Table 2 below for a few examples). In particular, we recommend *A
Quick Introduction to Version Control with Git and GitHub* by Blischak *et al.* \cite{blischak2016quick}.

In a nutshell, initialising a (local) repository (often abbreviated
_repo_) marks a directory as one to be tracked (Fig. 1). All or parts
of its content can be added explicitly to the list of files to track.

```
cd project ## move into directory to be tracked
git init   ## initialise local repository
## add individual files such as project description, reports, source code
git add README project.md code.R 
git commit -m "initial commit" ## saves the current local snapshot 
```

Subsequently, every change to the tracked files, once committed, will
be recorded as a new revision, or _snapshot_, uniquely identifying the
changes in all the modified files. Git is remarkably effective and efficient in
archiving the complete history of a project by,
among other things, storing only the differences between files.

In addition to local copies of the repository, it is straightforward to create
remote repositories on GitHub (called `origin`, with default branch
`master` - see below) using the web interface, and then synchronize
local and remote repositories.

```
git push origin master ## push local changes to the remote repository
git pull origin master ## pull remote changes into the local repository
```

Following Tony Rossini's advice in 2005 to "commit early, commit
often, and commit in a repository from which we can easily roll-back
your mistakes", one can organise their work in small
incremental changes. At any time it is possible to go back to a
previous version. In larger projects, multiple users are able to work on the 
same remote repository, with all contributions being recorded, restorable and attributed to the author.

Users usually track source code, text files, images, and small data
files inside their repositories, and generally do not track derived files
such as build logs or compiled binaries. And while the majority of
GitHub repositories are used for software development, users can also
keep text documents such as analysis
reports and manuscripts (see, for example, the repository for this
manuscript at \url{https://github.com/ypriverol/github-paper}).

Due to its distributed design, each up-to-date local git repository 
is an entire exact historical copy of everything that
was committed - file changes, commit message logs, etc. These copies
act as independent backups as well, present on each user's storage
device. Git can be considered to be fault-tolerant because of this,
which is a win over centralized version control systems. If the remote
GitHub server is unavailable, collaboration and work can continue
between users, as opposed to centralized alternatives.

The web interface offered by GitHub provides friendly tools to perform
many basic operations and a gentle introduction to a more rich and
complex set of functionalities. Various graphical
user-interface driven clients for managing git and GitHub repositories
are also available (\url{https://www.git-scm.com/downloads/guis}). Many editors
and development environments such as, for example, the popular RStudio editor
(\url{https://www.rstudio.com/}) for the R programming language \cite{R},
directly integrate with code versioning using git and GitHub. In
addition, for remote git repositories, GitHub provides its own features
that will be described in subsequent rules (Fig. 1).

![The structure of a GitHub-based project illustrating project structure and interactions with the community.](./figure01_overview.pdf)

> **Box 1** Using GitHub, or any similar versioning/tracking system is
> not a replacement for good project management; it is an extension,
> an improvement for good project and file managing (see for example
> \cite{Noble:2009}). One practical consideration when using GitHub,
> for example, is dealing with large binary files.  Binary files such
> as images, videos, executable files, or many raw data used in
> bioinformatics, are stored as a single large entity in git.  As a
> result, every change, even if minimal, leads to a complete new copy
> of the file in the repository, producing large size increments and
> the inability to search (see
> \url{https://help.github.com/articles/searching-code/}) and compare file
> content across revisions. Git offers a Large File Storage (LFS)
> module (\url{https://git-lfs.github.com/}) that replaces such large files
> with pointers, while the large binary file can be stored remotely,
> which results in small and faster repositories. Git LFS is also
> supported by GitHub, albeit with a space quota or for a fee, to
> retain your usual GitHub workflow
> (\url{https://help.github.com/categories/managing-large-files/})
> (Supplementary Note, Section 1).

> **Box 2** By default, GitHub repositories are freely visible to all.
> Many projects decide to share their work publicly and openly
> from the start of the project, in order to attract visibility and
> to benefit from contributions from the community early on. Some
> other groups prefer to work privately on projects until they are
> ready to share their work.  Private repositories ensure that work is
> hidden but also limit collaborations to just those users
> that are given access to the repository. These repositories can then
> be made public at a later stage, such as, for example, upon
> submission, acceptance, or publication of corresponding journal
> articles.  In some cases, when the collaboration was exclusively
> meant to be private, some repositories might never be made publicly
> accessible.

> **Box 3** Every repository should ideally have the following three
> files. The first, and arguably most important file in a repository
> is a LICENCE file (see also Rule 8), that clearly defines the
> permissions and restrictions attached to the code and other files in
> your repository. The second important file is a README file, which
> provides, for example, a short description of the project, a quick
> start guide, information on how to contribute, a TODO list,
> and links to additional documentation. Such README files are
> typically written in markdown, a simple markup language that is
> automatically rendered on GitHub. Finally, a CITATION file to
> the repository informs your users how to cite and credit your
> project.

# Rule 2. GitHub for single users, teams and organizations {-}

Public projects on GitHub are visible to everyone, but write
permission, i.e., the ability to directly modify the content of a
repository, needs to be granted explicitly. As a repository owner, you can
grant this right to other GitHub users. In addition to being owned
by users, repositories can also be created and managed as part of
teams and organizations.

Project managers can structure projects to manage permissions at
different levels: users, teams and organizations.  Users are the
central element of GitHub, as in any other social network. Every user has a
profile listing their GitHub projects and activities, which can
optionally be populated  with personal information including name, e-mail
address, image, and webpage. To stay up to date with the activity of
other users, one can _follow_ their accounts (see also Rule 10). Collaboration can be achieved by simply adding a trusted _Collaborator_, thereby granting write access.

However, development in large projects is usually done by teams of
people, within a larger organization. GitHub organizations are a great
way to manage team-based access permissions for the individual
projects of institutes, research labs, and large open source projects
that need multiple owners and administrators (Fig.  1). We recommend
that you, as an individual researcher, make your profile visible to
other users and display all of the projects and organisations you are
working in.

# Rule 3. Developing and collaborating on new features: branching and forking {-}

Anyone with a GitHub account can _fork_ any repository they can access. This
will create a complete copy of the content of a repository,
retaining a link to the original 'upstream' version. One could
start working on the same code base in one's own fork
(\url{https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/}) under their username
(see, for example, \url{https://github.com/ypriverol/github-paper/network/members}
for this work) or organization (see Rule 2).
Forking a repository allows users to freely experiment with
changes without affecting the original project and forms the basis of social coding.
It allows anyone to develop and test novel
features with existing code and offers the possibility of contributing
novel features, bug fixes, and
improvements to documentation
(\url{https://twitter.com/rgfitzjohn/status/708309767240982528}) back into
the original upstream project (requested by opening an _pull request_),
repository and becoming a contributor. Forking a repository and
providing pull requests constitutes a simple method for collaboration
inside loosely defined teams and over more formal organizational
boundaries, with the original repository owner(s) retaining control over
which external contributions are accepted. Once a pull request is opened
for review and discussion, it usually results in additional insights
and increased code quality \cite{Dabbish:2012}.

Concurrent development -- that is, users making commits in parallel to
the same repository -- can be organised using different approaches. The
most common way is to use git _branches_ to separate different lines
of development. Active development is often performed on a development
branch and stable versions, i.e., those used for a software release, are
kept in a master or release branch (see for example
\url{https://github.com/OpenMS/OpenMS/branches}).  In practice, developers
often work concurrently on one or several features or improvements. To
keep commits of the different features logically separated, distinct
branches are typically used. Later, when development is complete and
verified to work (i.e., none of the tests fail, see Rule 5), new features can be merged back
into the development line or master branch. In addition, one can
always pull the currently up-to-date master branch into a feature
branch, to adapt the feature to the changes in the master branch.

When developing different features in parallel, there is a risk of
applying incompatible changes in different branches/forks; these are said
to become _out of sync_. Branches are just short-term departures from
master. If you pull frequently, you will keep your copy of the repository up
to date, and you will have the opportunity to merge your changed code
with others' contributors, ideally without requiring you to manually address
conflicts to bring the branches in sync again.

# Rule 4. Naming branches and commits: tags and semantic versions {-}

Tags can be used to label versions during the development
process. Version numbering should follow
`semantic versioning' practice, with the format X.Y.Z, with X being the major, Y the minor, and Z the patch version of the release, including possible meta
information, as described in \url{http://semver.org/}. This semantic
versioning scheme provides users with coherent version numbers that
document the extent (bug fixes or new functionality) and backwards
compatibility of new releases. Correct labeling allows developers and
users to easily recover older versions, compare them, or simply use
them to reproduce results described in publications (see Rule 8). This
approach also help to define a coherent software publication
strategy.

# Rule 5: Let GitHub do some tasks for you: integrate {-}

The first rule of software development is that the code needs to be
ready to use as soon as possible \cite{Leprevost:2014}, to remain so
during development, and that it should be well-documented and
tested. In 2005, Martin Fowler defined the basic principles for
continuous integration in software development \cite{FowlerCI}. These
principles have become the main reference for best practices in
continuous integration, providing the framework needed to deploy
software, and in some way, also data. In addition to mere error-free
execution, dedicated code testing is aimed at detecting possible bugs
introduced by new features, or changes in the code or dependencies, as
well as detecting wrong results, often known as _logic errors_, where
the source code produces a different result than what was intended.
Continuous integration provides a way to automatically and systematically run a series of tests to check integrity and performance of code, a task that can be automated through GitHub.

GitHub offers a set of _hooks_ (automatically executed scripts) that are
run after each push to a repository, making it easier to follow the
basic principles of continuous integration. The GitHub web hooks
allows third-party platforms to access and interact with a GitHub
repository and thus to automate post-processing tasks. Continuous
integration can be achieved by _Travis CI_ (\url{https://travis-ci.org}), a
hosted continued integration platform that is free for all open source
projects. Travis CI builds and tests the source code using a plethora of
options such as different platforms and interpreter versions
(Supplementary Note, Section 2). In addition, it offers notifications
that allow your team and contributors to know if the new changes
work, and to prevent the introduction of errors in the code (for instance,
when merging pull requests), making the repository always ready to
use. 

# Rule 6: Let GitHub do more tasks for you: automate {-}

More than just code compilation and testing can be integrated
into your software project: GitHub hooks can be used to automate
numerous tasks to help improve the overall quality of your project. A
important complement to successful test completion is to demonstrate
that the tests sufficiently cover the existing code base. For this, the
integration of _Codecov_ is recommended (\url{https://codecov.io}).  This
service will report how much of the code base and which lines of code
are being executed as part of your code tests. The Bioconductor
project, for example, highly recommends that packages implement unit
testing (Supplementary Note, Section 2) to support developers in their package development and
maintenance
(\url{http://bioconductor.org/developers/unitTesting-guidelines/}), and
systematically tests the coverage of all of its packages
(\url{https://codecov.io/github/Bioconductor-mirror/}). One might also
consider generating the documentation upon code/documentation
modification (Supplementary Note, Section 3). This implies that your
projects provide comprehensive documentation so others can understand
and contribute back to them. For Python or C/C++ code, automatic
documentation generation can be done using sphinx
(\url{http://sphinx-doc.org/}) and subsequently integrated into GitHub using
"Read the Docs" (\url{https://readthedocs.org/}). All of these platforms
will create reports and badges (sometimes called shields) that can be
included on your GitHub project page, helping to demonstrate that the
content is of high quality and well-maintained.

# Rule 7. Use GitHub to openly and collaboratively discuss, address and close issues {-}

GitHub _issues_ are a great way to keep track of bugs, tasks, feature
requests, and enhancements. While classical issue trackers are primarily
intended to be used as bug trackers, in contrast, GitHub issue
trackers follow a different philosophy: each tracker has
its own section in every repository and can be used to trace bugs,
new ideas, and enhancements, by using a powerful tagging
system. _Issues_ main focus is on promoting collaboration, providing
context by using cross-references.

Raising an issue does not require lengthy forms to be completed. It only
requires a title, and preferably at least a short description. Issues have
very clear formatting, and provide space for optional comments, which allow
anyone with a github account to provide feedback. For example, if the developer
needs more information to be able to reproduce a bug, he or she can simply
request it in a comment.

Additional elements of issues are (i) color-coded labels that help to
categorize and filter issues, (ii) milestones, and (iii) one assignee
responsible for working on the issue. They help developers to filter
and prioritise tasks and turn issue tracker into a planning tool for their
project.

It is also possible for repository administrators to create issue and pull
request (see Rule 3) templates
(\url{https://help.github.com/articles/helping-people-contribute-to-your-project/})
to customize and standardize the information to be included when
contributors open issues. GitHub issues are thus dynamic, and they pose a
low entry barrier for users to report bugs and request features. A
well-organized and tagged issue tracker helps new contributors and
users to understand a project more deeply. As an example, one
issue in the OpenMS repository
(\url{https://github.com/OpenMS/OpenMS/issues/1095}) allowed the interaction
of eight developers and attracted more than hundred comments. Contributors can
add figures, comments, and references to other _issues_ and _pull
requests_ in the repository, as well as direct references to code.

As another illustration of _issues_ and their generic and wide
application, we (\url{https://github.com/ypriverol/github-paper/issues}) and
others (\url{https://github.com/ropensci/RNeXML/issues/121}) used GitHub
issues to discuss and comment changes in manuscripts and address
reviewers' comments.

# Rule 8. Make your code easily citable, and cite source code! {-}

It is a good research practice to ensure permanent and unambiguous
identifiers for citable items like articles, datasets, or biological
entities such as proteins, genes and metabolites (see
also Box 3). Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs) have been used for many
years as unique and unambiguous identifiers for enabling the citation
of scientific publications. More recently, a trend has started to
mint DOIs for other types of scientific products such as datasets
\cite{Vizcaino:2014} and training materials (for example
\cite{Ahmadia_2015_27353}). A key motivation for this is to build a
framework for giving scientists broader credit for their work
\cite{NatBiotechEditorial:2009,force11-scwg}, while simultaneously
supporting clearer, more persistent ways to cite and track it. Helping
to drive this change are funding agencies such as the NIH and NSF in the USA
and Research Councils in the UK, who are increasingly recognizing the
importance of research products such as publicly available datasets
and software.

A common issue with software is that it normally evolves at a
different speed than text published in the scientific literature. In
fact, it is common to find software having novel features and
functionality that were not described in the original
publication. GitHub now integrates with archiving services such as
Zenodo (\url{https://zenodo.org/}) and Figshare (\url{https://figshare.com/}),
enabling DOIs to be assigned to code repositories. The procedure is
relatively straightforward (see
\url{https://guides.github.com/activities/citable-code/}), requiring only
the provision of metadata and a series of administrative steps. By
default, Zenodo creates an archive of a repository each time a new
release is created in GitHub, ensuring the cited code remains up to
date.  Once the DOI has been assigned, it can be added to literature
information resources such as Europe PubMed Central
\cite{EuropePMCConsortium:2015}.

As already mentioned in the introduction, reproducibility of
scientific claims should be enabled by providing the software, the
datasets and the process leading to interpretable results that were
used in a particular study. As much as possible, publications should
highlight that the code is freely available in, for example, GitHub,
together with any other relevant outputs that may have been
deposited. In our experience, this openness substantially increases
the chances of getting the paper accepted for publication. Journal
editors and reviewers receive the opportunity to reproduce findings
during the manuscript review process, increasing confidence in
the reported results. In addition, once the paper is published, your work can
be reproduced by other members of the scientific community, which can
increase citations and foster opportunities for further discussion and
collaboration.

The availability of a public repository containing the source code
does not make the software open source _per se_. You should use an OSI
approved license (\url{https://opensource.org/licenses/alphabetical}) that
defines how the software can be freely used, modified and
shared. Common licenses such as those listed on
\url{http://choosealicense.com} are preferred. Note that the LICENSE file in
the repository should be a plain-text file containing the contents of
an OSI approved license, not just a reference to the license.

# Rule 9. Promote and discuss your projects: web page and more {-}

The traditional way to promote scientific software is by publishing an associated paper
in the peer-reviewed scientific literature, though as pointed out by Buckheir and Donoho,
this is just advertizing [TODO: add citation to paper on http://statweb.stanford.edu/~wavelab/Wavelab_850/wavelab.pdf]. Additional steps can
boost the visibility of a organization. For example, GitHub _Pages_
are simple websites freely hosted by GitHub. Users can create and host blog
websites, help pages, manuals, tutorials and websites related to
specific projects. _Pages_ comes with a powerful static site generator
called Jekyll (\url{https://jekyllrb.com}) that can be integrated with other
frameworks such as Bootstrap (\url{http://getbootstrap.com/}) or platforms
such as Disqus (\url{https://disqus.com/}), to support and moderate
comments.  

In addition, several real-time communication platforms have
been integrated with GitHub such as Gitter (\url{http://gitter.im}) and
Slack (\url{https://slack.com/}). Real-time communication systems allow the
user community, developers and project collaborators to exchange ideas
and issues, and to report bugs or get support. For example, Gitter is
a GitHub-based chat tool that enables developers and users to share
aspects of their work. Gitter inherits the network of social groups
operating around GitHub repositories, organizations, and issues. It
relies on identities within GitHub, creating IRC (Internet Relay
Chat)-like chat rooms for public and private projects. Within a
Gitter chat, members can reference issues, comments, and pull
requests.  GitHub also supports wikis (which are version-controlled
repositories themselves) for each repository, where users can create
and edit pages for documentation, examples, or general support.

A different service is Gist (\url{https://gist.github.com}), which
represents a unique way to share _code snippets_, single files, parts
of files, or full applications. Gists can be generated in two different
ways: public _gists_ that can be browsed and searched through _Discover_
(\url{https://gist.github.com/discover}), and secret gists that are hidden
from search engines. One of the main features of Gist
is the possibility of embedding code snippets in other applications,
enabling users to embed gists in any text field that supports
JavaScript. 

# Rule 10. Use GitHub to be social: follow and watch {-}

In the same way as researchers are following developments in their field,
scientific programmers could follow publicly available projects that might
benefit their research.
GitHub enables this functionality by _following_ other GitHub users (see also
Rule 2) or _watching_ the activity of projects, which is a common
feature in many social media platforms. Take advantage of it as much
as possible!

# Conclusions {-}

If you are involved in scientific research and have not used git and
GitHub before, we recommend that you to explore its potential as soon as
possible. As with many tools a learning curve lays ahead, but several basic yet powerful features are accessible even to the beginner and may be applied to many different use-cases \cite{ram2013git}. We anticipate the reward will be worth your effort. To conclude, we would like to recommend some examples of
bioinformatics repositories in GitHub (Table 1) and some useful
training materials, including workshops, online courses and manuscripts
(Table 2).
